== PROJECT: Restaurant Management System

---

== Overview

Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a desktop restaurant management application used to help restaurant managers oversee their various processes in a more elegant and efficient way.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added statistics features for all the different data stored in the RMS.
** What it does: Allows restaurant managers to view the statistics of the menus, orders, members and employees.
** Justification: This feature will be able to let the restaurant managers understand how his restaurant is currently performing as well as to keep track of the employees schedule.
** Highlights: Data displayed under the different statistics commands have to be easy to understand as well as useful to the restaurant managers.
It required thinking from a perspective of a restaurant manager to understand what kind of data he/she would want to see.
This implementation was challenging because I also had to make use of the limited data the other features were able to provide.
