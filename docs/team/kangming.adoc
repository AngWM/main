== PROJECT: Restaurant Management System

---

== Overview

Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a desktop restaurant management application used to help restaurant managers oversee their various processes in a more elegant and efficient way.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Created a membership platform for the RMS
** What it does: The membership platform allows the restaurant to keep track of its existing members and accumulate their membership points. It also allows the restaurant manager / cashier to list, add and delete members from the system.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is an innovative way for restaurants to retain their customers.
** Highlights: It is essential that the membership system is well integrated together with the order system. This is to ensure that when an order is made by an existing member, the member's membership points will correspondingly be updated. Also, the commands implemented should be easy to understand and use for a non-tech savvy audience. It is important that the invalid command formats are properly taken care of in a way that it guides the user with examples on how to properly use the platform.
