== PROJECT: Restaurant Management System

---

== Overview

Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a desktop restaurant management application used to help restaurant managers oversee their various processes in a more elegant and efficient way.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added menu features.
** What it does: Allows cashiers to view, list and find menu items when taking orders. It also allows cashiers to view, list, add and delete menu items
** Justification: Since the product is catered to restaurants, this feature is an important feature for the product as menu management and accessing is one of the most important aspect of managing any restaurants.
** Highlights: Needed to ensure that the commands implemented would be easy to understand and use for a non-tech savvy audience. The commands had to properly take care of invalid command formats and guide the user with examples on how to properly use the command when such invalid command formats are encountered.
